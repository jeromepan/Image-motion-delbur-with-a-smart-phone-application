Abstract

  The enhancement of blurred photographs is a challenging task in digital image processing. In some cases, the motion blur can be reduced in order to recognize symbolic content, which is of particular interest in investigative journalism and forensic science. An algorithm for selected practical cases is designed and tested for further implementation in a smartphone app for real-time deblurring.
